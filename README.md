# EE267 Homework
This is a repository for the starter code of homework for [EE267 (Spring 2021, Stanford University)](https://stanford.edu/class/ee267/). We are going to release the starter code of each homework weekly here.

# Tutorial of Git and GitHub
If it is your first time to use Git, please go through one of the tutorials of Git to understand basic functionalities. If you know how to `clone`, `commit` and `pull`, you can skip it. The GitHub's official basic tutorial is available [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

# How to start homework (Homework 1)
You can either use CUI or GUI to clone this repository. However, *please do not **Download ZIP** this repository!* If you prefer the GUI way, you can use [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone this repository.

If you prefer the CUI way, you can clone this repository to your local machine through your terminal by
```shell
git clone https://github.com/computational-imaging/EE267-Spring2021.git
```
Then, you are good to go! Enjoy the homework! The submission procedure is described in the homework document.

# How to get the following homework (Homework 2~)
Now, you should have this repository in your local machine. Before pulling the new homework, you need to make a commit of your change in your local repository.
For example, you can execute
```shell
git add --all
git commit -m "Your message. (eg. Homework 1 is done.)"
```
Then, execute
```shell
git pull origin master
```

# GitHub usage for homework
You are encouraged to use GitHub to collaborate with your teammate, but *please do not make a public repository for homework or fork this repository.*
As a student, you have unlimited private repositories for free (see [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack)).


# For people outside of the class
Although this is a public repository, it is not under any open source license.
You are welcome to download the code to implement the homework for your self-learning.
However, you are not allowed to redistribute it in any manner such as forking this repository or uploading the code to a public website.
If you are interested in reusing the code for your academic institution, feel free to get in touch with us.
